* [Data breaches break record in 2021](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/record-number-of-data-breaches-reported-in-2021-new-report-says/)

  The Identity Theft Resource Center has reported that 2021 saw the highest amount of data breaches to date. The record indicates a 68% increase from 2020’s total and a 23% increase from the previous all-time high. This is a crucial topic to address, as there is no indication that data breaches will slow down in the coming years. There is a general trend in which cybercriminals are shifting towards more focused attacks instead of massive data breaches. Following 2021’s trend, it is expected that ransomware will surpass phishing as the most likely data breach in 2022. It is encouraged that all individuals practice safe cyber practices to reduce their own risk of becoming the victim of these attacks. Interestingly, the military had no data breaches in 2021, despite an increase across all other sectors. 

* [Bitcoin less green since China ban, research suggests](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60521975)
  
  Bitcoin mining was banned in Chinese provinces around June 2021, where an abundance of hydropower was the main source of energy for bitcoin mining in the country. This move has led to miners moving to other areas with cheap electricity such as the US and Kazakhstan. Specifically, moving to the US has increased the use of fossil fuels to power the specialized computers that verify crypto transactions. The article relates an estimate in which the use of renewable energy for mining dropped from 41.6% in 2020 to 25.1% in August of 2021 due to the ban that has moved mining out of China. A single bitcoin transaction has a carbon footprint of about 669 kilograms of carbon dioxide, which is comparable to the carbon emissions from a flight from Amsterdam to New York per-passenger. The article concludes with a call for international cooperation in the push towards decarbonization of the crypto industry.

* [Why Russian people need tech companies to stay, not withdraw: It’s terrifying ‘how dark that place could become’](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/17/why-russian-people-need-tech-companies-to-stay.html)

  Businesses are closing operations in Russia and sanctions are being imposed on the country, but tech businesses must be more thoughtful in their decisions to close off services to Russia. Tech such as social media and search engines are playing an important role in the spreading of information during the Russia-Ukraine war. There is a debate between some in Ukraine who believe tech businesses should oppose the Russian war by stopping their services in Russia. On the other hand, internet freedom experts argue that the move could have unintended consequences. Those experts believe calculated risks must be taken so that information or the ‘truth’ can remain available for Russians. Major tech companies, specifically social media platforms are facing a double edge sword in this dilemma. If they remove all their services to make a statement, they risk having Russia be filled with disinformation from the Russian government. On the other hand, they risk their services being used to fuel Kremlin propaganda. The article connects this dilemma of social media and internet access to the broader issues the world has been facing in the past few decades. Is the benefit of access to information greater than the risk of perpetuating false information and fueling violence? The former news director of a Russian search engine has pleaded for the major social media companies to change the content and take down the site all together if they wouldn’t. There is also a history of Russian censorship . In the past few weeks, Russia has restricted Facebook and Instagram, both Meta owned companies, once Meta refused to stop fact checking and labeling content as state-owned media. The Russian government may also be facing a dilemma in censorship during this time, as they use social media platforms to spread propaganda as well as to monitor potential unrest. In addition, the backlash from Russians makes the decision of censorship more complicated.
